MVP:

1. User Interface (UI): A functional and intuitive web-based interface for journalists to input interviewee details, topic context, and any specific parameters for the interview.

2. Question Generation: The AI-powered question generation system that analyzes the inputted information and generates a list of thought-provoking questions. The questions should be relevant, targeted, and designed to elicit informative responses.

3. Interview Preview: The ability for journalists to preview and customize the generated questions before conducting the interview. This allows them to fine-tune the list, add their own questions, or modify the sequence as needed.

4. Interviewee Profile Management: Basic functionality to manage interviewee profiles, including storing and retrieving information for future reference.

By delivering these core features, InterviewIQ's MVP showcases its key value proposition of assisting journalists in preparing impactful interviews and facilitating deeper insights from interviewees.
