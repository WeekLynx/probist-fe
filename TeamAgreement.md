# Team Agreement

## Cooperation Plan

Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

What are the key strengths of each person on the team?

Kyle - Persistant on problems
Dylan - Execution is on point
Gerald - Fresh Eyes, Problem solver with console, asks questions
Alex - Finds information,

How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?

Kyle - I will utilize my persistence in the project by relentlessly tackling challenges and continuously refining our work based on feedback
Dylan - 
Gerald - how I will best utilize my fresh eye skills is to ask questions hoping to learn and help keep our project goal in sight
Alex - When trying to overcome obstacales I ask clarifying questions and try to reseach for an answer.

In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?

Kyle - I am eager to expand my knowledge and skills in AI integration
Dylan - 
Gerald - I would like to grow my professional competencies in both front end design and AI intigration
Alex - Communications

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.

* Work in pairs
* Morning stand up : 30 mins - 1 hr
  * talk about what we are going to tackle for the day
  * blockers or obstacles
* Maybe get back together before lunch and at EOD

## Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

Describe at least:

What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

* Step back
* Take a break
* talk it out, if not possible.
* Grab someone to mediate.

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

* talk it through
* divide work loads as necessary

How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

Communication is KEY throughout, be honest with your knowledge and understanding.

How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

* talk it through
* divide work loads as necessary

How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

Get a Mediator

## Communication Plan

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

Describe at least:

What hours will you be available to communicate?

Normal operation hours, if needed we will go after hours or mornings.

Kyle - PST 0
Dylan - Alaska Time -1
Gerald - Eastern +3
Alex - PST 0

What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

Primary: Slack
Remo: for TAs

How often will you take breaks?

10-15 mins per hour as needed

What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

Talk it through with the team, with Audrey. Then get it done.

How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

Primary: Slack

What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

Primary: Slack
Listen then discuss

How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

Just be real
Confront the issue - at the end of the day. Receive feedback, give constructive criticism.

## Work Plan

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.

Describe at least:

How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

Outline our work and assign task on Trello. Put dates on things.

What project management tool will be used?

On Trello.

## GitHub Process

What components of your project will live on GitHub?
Front and Backend Repos

How will you share the repository with your teammates?
By putting the repos in an Org and having everyone as members.

What is your Git flow?
Push to our individual branchs the merge on to staging before pushing to main if there are no gituations.

Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:

* How many people must review a PR?
 Just 1 but preferable 2

* Who merges PRs?
Alex

* How often will you merge?
At least before lunch, and at least at EOD. Hopefully after every feature.

* How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?

On Slack, we can call out 10 15 mins prior to give people a chance to save.
